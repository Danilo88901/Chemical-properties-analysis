Conclusions:
 1. Boiling Point vs. Melting Point Correlation
The correlation between boiling and melting points is quite high, reaching approximately 0.81.
This value is slightly reduced when other parameters like molecular weight, heat of fusion, etc., are considered, where the correlation is 0.78. 
However, when comparing boiling and melting points in isolation, the correlation remains high (0.81), indicating that the two are closely related regardless of other factors.


2.Molecular Weight and Boiling Point
A significant correlation exists between molecular weight and boiling point, which is around 0.66 when comparing all parameters such as molecular weight, boiling point, melting point, and heat of fusion.
This correlation is nearly the same even when boiling point and molecular weight are considered separately, with a value of 0.65
 It shows that the molecular weight is an important factor in determining the boiling point of substances.

3.Effect of Molecular Weight on Correlation
As molecular weight increases, the correlation between molecular weight and boiling point, as well as molecular weight and melting point, increases as well
his is especially true for molecules with molecular weights greater than 200, where the correlation becomes significantly stronger (by approximately 0.1)
This implies that for molecules with higher molecular weights (e.g., >300), there is a much stronger chance that the boiling point will correlate with the molecular weight. 
This trend is similar for melting point as well.

4.Melting Point and Heat of Fusion
The highest correlation is observed between melting point and heat of fusion, which reaches 0.44
his indicates that as the melting point increases, the heat of fusion also increases, though the correlation is not as strong as between boiling and melting points. 
For example, substances with a melting point above 1000 K show higher correlation with heat of fusion, although the correlation remains moderate (around 0.36)
